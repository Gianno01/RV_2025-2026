  text: "Thank you\u2026thank you, child. You remind me of my wife\u2026She always
    helped everyone. I lost her\u2026when they bombed our neighborhood. Things have
    only gotten worse since then. We live between two fears now...the soldiers on
    one side, and the settlers on the other. Every day someone disappears. Every
    day, someone doesn\u2019t come back. You\u2019re looking for someone too, aren\u2019t
    you? Your brother\u2026don\u2019t give up, little one!"
